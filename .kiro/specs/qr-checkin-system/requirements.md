# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a QR code-based check-in system that allows users to check in to events without installing a mobile app. Users scan QR codes with their phone's built-in camera or QR scanning functionality, which opens a web form in their browser where they can enter their information and complete the check-in process. The system includes dynamic QR code generation, geofencing validation, and real-time admin monitoring.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an event admin, I want to create events with geofenced boundaries and generate dynamic QR codes, so that I can control where and when attendees can check in.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates an event THEN the system SHALL allow them to define a geofenced area (circle or polygon)
2. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL generate dynamic QR codes that refresh every 30-60 seconds
3. WHEN a QR code is generated THEN it SHALL contain a URL with eventID and timestamp parameters
4. WHEN a QR code expires THEN the system SHALL generate a new QR code automatically
5. IF an admin updates event settings THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future QR codes immediately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an event attendee, I want to scan a QR code with my phone's camera and fill out a simple web form, so that I can check in without installing any apps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scans a QR code THEN their default browser SHALL open to a mobile-optimized web form
2. WHEN the form loads THEN it SHALL request location permissions to get GPS coordinates
3. WHEN the form is displayed THEN it SHALL include fields for name, email, ID number, and optional selfie upload
4. WHEN a user submits the form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are completed
5. IF location permission is denied THEN the form SHALL still allow submission but warn about incomplete verification
6. WHEN form submission is successful THEN the user SHALL see a clear success message
7. WHEN form submission fails THEN the user SHALL see specific error messages explaining the reason

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the system, I want to validate QR codes and user locations in real-time, so that only authorized check-ins within the correct area and time window are accepted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a form is submitted THEN the system SHALL verify the QR code has not expired
2. WHEN a form is submitted THEN the system SHALL verify the QR code has not been reused
3. WHEN GPS coordinates are provided THEN the system SHALL verify the location is within the geofenced area
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL create a check-in record with timestamp and location
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return specific error codes and messages
6. IF a QR code is expired THEN the system SHALL provide a "scan again" option

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an event admin, I want to monitor check-ins in real-time and generate reports, so that I can track attendance and analyze location data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN check-ins occur THEN the admin dashboard SHALL update in real-time
2. WHEN an admin views the dashboard THEN they SHALL see current attendance numbers and recent check-ins
3. WHEN an admin requests location data THEN the system SHALL display a heatmap of check-in coordinates
4. WHEN an admin exports data THEN the system SHALL generate CSV/Excel files with all check-in records
5. WHEN viewing reports THEN admins SHALL be able to filter by time range, location, and user attributes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the web form to work with screen readers and keyboard navigation, so that I can complete check-in regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form loads THEN all form elements SHALL have proper ARIA labels and roles
2. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL be reachable via tab navigation
3. WHEN using a screen reader THEN form validation errors SHALL be announced clearly
4. WHEN the form is displayed THEN it SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
5. WHEN images are uploaded THEN alternative text options SHALL be available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to handle high concurrent loads and provide reliable data storage, so that the system remains responsive during large events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users scan QR codes simultaneously THEN the system SHALL respond within 2 seconds
2. WHEN QR codes are validated THEN Redis cache SHALL be used for fast lookup without database queries
3. WHEN check-in data is stored THEN PostgreSQL SHALL ensure data consistency and integrity
4. WHEN the system experiences high load THEN it SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime
5. IF database connection fails THEN the system SHALL queue requests and retry automatically
